# Exercise 1.2
## Structures: 
* For each recipie I chose to use dictionaries since they hold all different data types in a key: value pair for ease of access within itself indexed by identifiers in the keys.
* For the all recipies I once again chose to use dictionaries as they hold multiple recipies that can be changed or modifies within different data types to be able to call upon individually.
## Deliverables: 
* Screenshots of each step
* Updated Learning Journal
* README file
